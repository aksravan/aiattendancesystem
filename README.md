# aiattendancesystem
This is an AI attendance System, developed with opencv python.

In this attendance system a teacher is required to login first and then only attendance of the students can be captured.

Modules used- 
  cv2
  face_recognition
  keyboard
  os
  numpy
  smtplib
  time
  stdiomask
 
After taking attendance of the students this system can send mail to the specific teacher, 
but here in this program I used a single sender's and recevier's mail to recieve as this is just a project.
